**Objective:** Implement business logic for task management.

**Steps:**

- **Set Up Node.js Project:** Initialize a Node.js project with `npm init`.
- **Install Dependencies:** Use `npm install express sqlite3 body-parser`.
- **Implement Endpoints:** Use Express.js to setup routes that correspond to your API design.
    - For each route, connect to the SQLite database and execute the appropriate SQL query.
- **Error Handling:** Ensure your API handles errors gracefully and returns appropriate error messages.
### Authentication and Authorization

**Objective:** Secure the API using authentication and role-based access control.

**Steps:**

- **Implement User Authentication:** Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.
    - Install JWT library: `npm install jsonwebtoken`.
    - Create login and register endpoints that handle token creation and user authentication.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Implement middleware that checks if the authenticated user has the correct permissions to perform certain actions.
  ### Testing and Debugging (Optional)

**Objective:** Write tests and debug the backend.

**Steps:**

- **Unit Testing:** Use a testing framework like Jest.
    - Install Jest: `npm install --save-dev jest`.
    - Write tests for each API endpoint to ensure they perform as expected.
- **Integration Testing:** Test the integration of your API with the frontend.
- **Debugging:** Use console logs and Node.js debugging tools to trace and fix issues.
